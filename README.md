# The Colour Contrast

This is a colour contrast tool that is currently being built with React. Following the design principles by [Brad Frost, called Atom Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/). This is the first time using this design principle and probably be the only app that uses the principle from me.

So enjoy The Colour Contrast React app.
